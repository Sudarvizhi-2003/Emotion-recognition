**Emotion Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for emotion recognition from facial images. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial expressions and can accurately classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral.

**Features**

Train a CNN model for emotion recognition using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset.

Visualize training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) over epochs.

Deploy the trained model for real-world applications.

**Dependencies**

Python (>=3.6)

TensorFlow (>=2.0)

Keras (>=2.0)

Matplotlib (for visualization)

scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

OpenCV (for image preprocessing, if applicable)

**Usage**

Preprocess your dataset: Ensure your dataset contains labeled facial images and preprocess them as necessary (e.g., resizing, normalization).

Train the model: Run train.py to train the CNN model using your preprocessed dataset.

Evaluate the model: Run evaluate.py to evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset.

Visualize training metrics: Run visualize.py to plot training and validation accuracy/loss curves over epochs.

Deploy the model: Integrate the trained model into your application for real-time emotion recognition.
